# Changelog

## 0.1.4

Claims are a compare-and-swap: two agents reaching for the same work in the
same second cannot both hold it, and the loser is told who does. A full store
now refuses a claim in words instead of dropping it silently. `knos status`
reports the claims held and says FULL at 5 MB. The pull request Action reports
decisions as well as claims, takes a `github-token` input, and documents its
`pull_request_target` safety. `pytest` runs the critical path in about 25
seconds; `pytest -m ""` runs all of it.

**Use `drexthealpha/Knos/action@v0.1.4`.** `v0.1.3` was tagged before these
Action changes and serves the older file.

## 0.1.3

Declare MCP tool annotations (read-only, destructive, idempotent, open-world) on `search`, `about` and `remember`, and report the installed version in the handshake.
