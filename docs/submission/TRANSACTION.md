# One transaction, end to end, for a finance reader

Two records, both public, both test money. The first is one order on Solana devnet, run on 9 Oct 2026 with Knos
0.3.23 in Knos's own repository `drexthealpha/knos-witness`: there is no outside buyer, and the buyer and the supplier
are both Knos accounts. The second is a made-up invoice from a made-up supplier (`examples/shadow/invoice.csv`, which
says so in its first line), checked with GitHub's recorded answers so it runs with no network. Nothing here was sold.
Test USDC has no monetary value.

## 1. Terms and price, before any work

- The buyer funds issue #9 with 5.00 test USDC. The terms are posted as a `knos-terms` block and hashed at funding.
- The reply names the order account and the fee before any work: the funder pays 0.40 on top
  ([funded reply](https://github.com/drexthealpha/knos-witness/issues/9#issuecomment-6075144470),
  [funding transaction](https://explorer.solana.com/tx/3UaY22WKexigMpkVhibfeMdNgBiyybWm2Z4LuLskKGbNUDXV34yYWyH42atxFjELbrqSgoVs6TwpFzSQwhfXqzgM?cluster=devnet)).
- 0.40 is the order floor of knos_pay 2.1, the build deployed when the order was funded. Upgrade proposal 8 has
  since executed: knos_pay 2.2 charges 0.30% with a 0.05 floor, which on 5.00 is 0.05 ([../MANIFEST.md](../MANIFEST.md) has both schedules;
  [the price book](../MARKET.md#3-the-price-book)).

## 2. One result rejected, one accepted

- Rejected: the first work on pull request #10 failed the acceptance checks, and nothing was paid
  ([the failed run](https://github.com/drexthealpha/knos-witness/actions/runs/37890511112/job/113690226126)).
- Accepted: the corrected work passed at commit `7abbc32`
  ([the passing run](https://github.com/drexthealpha/knos-witness/actions/runs/37890595056/job/113690482455)).
  GitHub signed that run; the program checked the signature and paid 5.00
  ([payment](https://explorer.solana.com/tx/2PtmKUrQHKPARZE4nr35Te559NGQSG7tSHUfwzcKCAjL7gzvQ76fNTVLMWvq8mcZLxd27tbyTe31mCk2PxEGfAqa?cluster=devnet)).
- Cheating submissions are measured apart, judge by judge, in [../TAMPER.md](../TAMPER.md).

## 3. Both sides rebuild the invoice

- The order: the buyer's and the supplier's statements each have one line, agreed, and the same sha256,
  `a3791c5d92a545a16b0486a01b9d70f091e3e431074a5b6cbb47549c7a110280`
  ([the record](https://github.com/drexthealpha/knos-witness/blob/acaa854d241c2e030f521b6f5603c8f43c93bab6/witness.json)). The line's "settled" step is
  still open: the statement does not yet record the payment.
- The made-up invoice: 7 lines, 2,900.00. Both sides run
  `knos shadow examples/shadow/invoice.csv --recorded examples/shadow/recorded.json` and get one statement, sha256
  `fd4ca7b1d9fee16ad97d60a455dec37c7abdd1a81b2f5be64299ac223351b40b`:

| Lines | Amount | Finding |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| 2 | 650.00 | checks passed at merge |
| 1 | 650.00 | a check failed at merge: disputed |
| 1 | 300.00 | not merged: disputed |
| 2 | 800.00 | duplicate: the same pull request twice, and a second one closing the same issue |
| 1 | 500.00 | could not be read: not judged |

  In dispute: 1,750.00 of 2,900.00. A failed check is GitHub's record, not proof the work is bad.

## 4. Payment by the rule, and a retry with no second effect

- The program paid because GitHub's signature on the passing run checked out under the funded terms. No person
  approved the transfer.
- A replay of the same proof was refused and paid nothing
  ([the refusal](https://github.com/drexthealpha/knos-witness/pull/10#issuecomment-6075196710)): each proof leaves a
  single-use marker on chain.

## 5. What an independent operator runs

- `pip install knos`, then the `knos shadow` command above: the same sha256, with no network.
- `python examples/witnessed/witness.py run --login YOU` repeats the order in your own repository with test USDC
  ([../../examples/witnessed/README.md](../../examples/witnessed/README.md)).
- The archive `witness.zip` carries its own verifier, which needs no Knos.

Nobody outside Knos has run either yet.
