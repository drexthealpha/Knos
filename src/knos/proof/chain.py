"""The relay's chain of runs: starting the next run so that one bad answer does not end it, and a watchdog.

The always-on worker (.github/workflows/worker.yml) is a chain: each run starts the next one 30 s before it stops.
In the 0.3.19 release run GitHub answered HTTP 500 to that start, and the chain was down until a person started it
again. Two things here, both with nothing but the standard library (the watchdog job installs nothing):

    python -m knos.proof.chain start --after <this run>     the handover: asked again after a 5xx, a 429 or no answer,
                                                            waiting 2, 4, 8, ... s (or what Retry-After says)
    python -m knos.proof.chain watch                        the watchdog: starts a chain when none is alive, and
                                                            replaces a run with no heartbeat in time

GitHub may take a start and still answer with an error. So before a start is asked again the runs are listed, and a
run that already took over ends the asking. When the listing fails too the start is asked again all the same: of
two runs that take over from one run the worker's first step lets the older one go on, and of two runs nobody
handed over to (two watchdogs, or a watchdog and a person) the older one. Nothing here reads a key.

ALIVE MEANS A HEARTBEAT (0.3.21). In the 0.3.20 release run a run sat in its PyPI install wait, the watchdog counted it
alive because it existed, and the chain was down until a person restarted it. So "a run exists" is no longer enough:

    the heartbeat     the relay job's step HEARTBEAT, run right after the relay showed it starts with what was
                      installed. GitHub lists each step of a job with its status and the time it completed
                      (`GET /repos/{repo}/actions/runs/{id}/jobs`), so the watchdog reads the beat with no secret.
    alive             queued for less than QUEUED_MOST; or in progress with a beat less than BEAT_MOST old; or in
                      progress with no beat yet, started less than INSTALL_MOST ago (it is installing).
    stuck             in progress and none of that: no beat INSTALL_MOST after it started (an install that hangs), or
                      a beat older than BEAT_MOST (a relay that hangs). The watchdog cancels it, waits until GitHub
                      lists it ended (force-cancel when a cancel is not enough), and starts one run in its place.
    unknown           GitHub did not list a run's jobs: that run counts as alive (two chains are worse than a late one).

After a start the watchdog waits until GitHub lists the new run, so the next watchdog (they run one at a time) sees it:
two watchdogs never start two chains.
