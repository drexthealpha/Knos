"""A repo's proof history, in its Sibyl store: every claim and verdict, what the evidence showed later, and the checks
that history makes required.

    record(...)   a claim, the checks run, the verdict (entity `proof_claim`)
    observe(...)  later evidence about a commit, e.g. CI failed at 54ce98ad (entity `proof_outcome`)
    lint()        claims the evidence contradicts: "shipped" at a commit whose CI failed
    learn()       each contradiction becomes a required check (entity `proof_rule`): from then on, a claim of that kind
                  runs that check whatever the message says. Sibyl's own MemoryClient.learn() runs too when the
                  account has Sibyl Pro (playbooks across the journal); the rules here need no tier. Each flagged PR
                  (a repo-rule violation) becomes a `repo_rule`, required as `rule:<id>` on every claim after.
    repo_rules()  the repo's own rules: CONTRIBUTING.md parsed into machine-checkable rules (stored in Sibyl the first
                  time, recalled from Sibyl after) plus the rules past rejections taught it (entity `repo_rule`)
    lint_pr()     every place a PR's diff or commits break one of those rules, citing the rule's line and the PR's
    learn_tamper()  a caught tamper (a prove.judge finding's `pattern`) becomes a `tamper` entity and two proof_rules
                  scoped repo=... and agent=...: every later proof for that repo or by that agent must run
                  `tamper:<pattern>` (required_for / tamper_checks_required)

    lessons(), export_lessons(), import_lessons()   what the judge learned, as JSON lines, so it can travel between
                  runs on GitHub (knos.proof.memory keeps them in the repository's `knos-memory` issue). They are
                  loaded into a Sibyl store and read from there; nothing decides from the lines themselves.

    refuse(), accept(), refusals(), owed(), track(), briefing(), recall()
                  the agent's own track record on this repository, across sessions. Each verdict of the Stop hook is
                  one event in Sibyl's journal (the COLD tier: append-only, newest first) and the running count is one
                  state document (the HOT tier, rewritten in place). A check a refusal named is owed on every later
                  "done" here, whatever the message says, until a verdict shows it passing; `briefing` says what failed
                  last time and `recall` finds it by its words (Sibyl's FTS5 search across tiers). The proof rules
                  above stay entities (the WARM tier).

    refused(), refused_before(), preflight_seen(), appeal_outcome(), supplier_event(), supplier_record()
                  what the supplier's side of an order remembers: each refusal under given terms (so `knos preflight`
                  can say "3 earlier submissions were refused for touching tests/conftest.py" before a fourth is
                  sent), each preflight result, each appeal and how it ended, and one supplier's record across them
                  (accepted, rejected, appealed, overturned). Entities, found by Sibyl's own search anchored to one
                  category (`search_entities(..., category=...)`, sibyl-memory-client 0.8) and never by a side file.

    exception_opened(), exception_resolved(), exceptions_before(), exception_queue(), terms_text(), period_closed(),
    periods_closed()
                  what the buyer's side remembers of an exception (a statement line, an appeal or a correction that was
                  not simply agreed), each tier doing the work the engine names it for: the live queue is one state
                  document (HOT), one entity per supplier-and-terms holds how their exceptions ended (WARM), each
                  resolution is one journal event (COLD, append-only), the text of the terms is a reference document
                  (REFERENCE), and a closed period is an entity moved to the archive (ARCHIVE). `knos recall exception`
                  (knos.recall) answers from them: how the same exception under the same terms ended before.

    approval_kept(), approval_recalled()
                  the approver's defence six months later, in the buyer's tenant: one entity per commitment (WARM) holds
                  every approval record given for it (who, amount, policy version, evidence hash, why, expiry), each one
                  also a journal event (COLD) the entity is checked against. `knos recall approval` answers from them.

    outcome_granted(), grant_withdrawn(), onboarded(), reuse(), supplier_brings()
                  supplier reuse, in the SUPPLIER's tenant: what a buyer granted it to carry (accepted terms, results,
                  value; WARM, a withdrawn grant ARCHIVED), and each buyer's time from first order to first payment, so
                  the second buyer's onboarding is set against the first's. `knos recall supplier` answers from them.

`NullStore` keeps nothing: the same engine with no memory, which is what a plain hook amounts to.
