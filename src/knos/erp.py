"""The statement of one invoice as the bill-import file of the approver's accounting system: `knos statement export
FILE --to xero|quickbooks|netsuite|csv`.

The person who approves an invoice works in an accounting system, not here. This module writes, from one statement and
its status file, the file that system's bill import documents (TARGETS: the columns, where they come from, what could
not be confirmed), and a second sheet beside it:

    the payable file   one bill per line whose policy is met and that is not owed to the supplier; its memo (or, for
                       Xero, whose bill template has no memo, its description) carries the line's four steps (policy
                       satisfied, parties accepted, payment authorised, settled) and its assurance level
    the held sheet     every other line: disputed, owed to the supplier (refused, or not authorised in time, though its
                       policy is met), duplicate, or without enough evidence, each with why. These never reach the payable

The same statement, status, options and day give the same bytes. web/erp.js is the same code for the statement page
(tests/web/erp.mjs holds the two equal). Each file is a file export, not an integration: nobody has imported one
into the product yet (knos.exports.IMPORTED).
