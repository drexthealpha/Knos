"""Who may approve what, and whether they did: an approval policy, approvals as events, and the chain a request needs.

    knos approve record --repo acme/widgets --comment 2291 --offer .knos/procurement/offers/bug-fix-octocat.yaml
    knos approve check  --approver mei-acme --requester ravi-acme --amount 1200 [--on 2026-10-06] [--as finance]
    knos approve status --offer .knos/procurement/offers/bug-fix-octocat.yaml

The policy is one file in the buyer's repository, `.knos/procurement/policy.yaml` (docs/CONTROLS.md has the schema):
four roles (requester, approver, finance, auditor), the forge accounts that hold each and between which dates, and
thresholds that say how many approvers an amount needs and from where finance signs too.

An approval is a person's assent, and it is taken the way a funding is: a comment by the named account on the forge,

    /knos approve offer:bug-fix-octocat            (or: /knos approve offer:bug-fix-octocat as finance)

which `knos approve record` reads back through the forge's API. Who wrote it and when are the forge's answer, never
the caller's word. The event it appends to `.knos/procurement/approvals.jsonl` carries the comment's address and the
sha256 of its text, so anyone can read the same comment again. That is all the signature there is: Knos adds no key
of its own, and whoever controls the forge account controls the approval.

Authority is code, judged for the day the comment was written (`check`): the account must hold the role on that day,
may not approve its own request above the policy's `self_approval_limit`, and may not pass its own `limit`. A refusal
is one plain sentence. `chain` re-judges every event of a request against the policy, so a log somebody edited by
hand gains nothing: an approval without authority is not counted, and the answer says why.

The policy judged is the file as given. To judge an old approval by the policy of its day, give that day's file:
`git show <commit>:.knos/procurement/policy.yaml`. The event records the sha256 of the policy it was judged by.

web/procure.js is the same code for the console; tests/data/procure_cases.json holds both to one answer.
