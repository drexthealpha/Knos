"""Paying an approved statement through a rail the buyer already has: a bank.

    knos statement pay <file> --rail bank --payer-name N --payer-account IBAN --payees payees.csv
    knos statement status <file> --from <the bank's status report>

`pain001` writes one ISO 20022 customer credit transfer initiation (pain.001.001.09) for the lines that are agreed,
approved and still payable, and for nothing else: one transfer per supplier. A disputed or duplicate line, a line
without enough evidence, a line nobody approved and a line that is already paid or already instructed is never in it.

    end-to-end id    the settlement id (knos.ids: stl_ and 24 hex characters), made from the statement's hash, the
                     supplier and the invoice lines the transfer pays. A bank carries it to the payee and back.
    remittance       first "KNOS <the statement's sha256> INV <invoice>", then the invoice line ids, four to a line.

`read_status` reads what the bank answers: a customer payment status report (pain.002, any version: it is read by
element name) or a CSV (`end_to_end_id,status,reference,date,reason`). `apply` marks each line of a settled transfer
paid outside Knos and each line of a rejected one payable again, with the bank's reason. Reading one report twice
changes nothing.

`accepted_rows` is what the month's bill is made from: one row per agreed deliverable that was paid, whichever rail
paid it, so Acceptance is charged on it once; a deliverable the program released says `on_chain`, and its fee was
taken there.

What was checked, and what was not. `check` holds a file to the message definition's structure: the namespace, the
order and presence of every element this module writes, their lengths and patterns, and that the counts and the control
sum are the transfers'. It is written by hand from the published definition (docs/RAILS.md names the pages read); the
official schema file is not in this repository and the file was not run through it. NO BANK HAS TAKEN A FILE THIS
MODULE WROTE. A bank's own rules (which characters, how many remittance lines, which agent identifiers) are narrower
than the definition and differ by bank.

Nothing here moves money. The file is an instruction the payer uploads to their own bank.
