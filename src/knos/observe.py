"""What an outside observer can infer about a work order: `knos observe`.

Hiding a repository's name is not privacy when the counterparties, the amounts and the timing are public. This module
plays the outsider and nothing more: it reads ONLY what anyone can read with no account and no permission,

    the chain    the transactions that named an order, its Balance or wallet, and the token accounts its instructions
                 took: their log lines (records.events_of), their instruction data (a token GitHub signed is written to
                 knos_oidc whole, and stays in that data after the account is closed) and the order's account while it
                 is open;
    GitHub       the public API, with no credential: `repositories/<id>` and `user/<id>` turn an id into a name
                 (a private repository answers 404). Skipped with `--offline`.

and says, fact by fact, whether the outsider learns it ("yes"), learns only a hash of it ("only a hash") or does not
("no"), and from which account field or log line. `order_facts` is the table of one order; `graph` is what the whole
history says of one GitHub id: who it pays, who pays it, how much and how often.

A source of chain data is anything with `transactions(address, limit)` (the successful transactions that named the
address, oldest first, as `getTransaction` gives them with encoding "json"), `transaction(signature)` and
`account(address)`: `Rpc` asks a cluster, `Recorded` holds transactions a test recorded. The tables in docs/PRIVACY.md
are written by `python -m knos.observe --render-doc` from tests/data/observe.json, which tests/test_observe.py records
from the programs' test builds and holds to them.

Nothing here is a privacy guarantee: it is a list of what was found, and a careful outsider may find more."""
