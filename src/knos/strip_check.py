"""The workflow-strip hole, read from GitHub: can the buyer remove the Knos workflow before merging?

A buyer who controls a repository can delete or edit the Knos workflow in the merging pull request itself, so the
check that would have refused the work never runs. What closes it is GitHub's, not Knos's:

    closed   a ruleset requires the Knos workflow (a `workflows` rule: "Require workflows to pass before merging").
             The workflow runs from the file the rule pins, not the pull request's copy. Only an organization or
             enterprise ruleset on GitHub Enterprise Cloud can carry that rule: a personal repository, or an
             organization on another plan, cannot (GitHub answers HTTP 422 "Invalid rule 'workflows'"). Closed only for
             people who cannot edit or bypass that ruleset: an organization owner (for an organization ruleset) or a
             repository admin (for a repository one) can still remove it.
    partly   a required status check names a Knos check (rulesets or classic branch protection). The merge waits for
             a check of that name, so removing the workflow alone blocks the merge. Still open: a pull request can change
             the workflow that produces the check, and an admin can remove the requirement. On a personal repository,
             or an organization without Enterprise Cloud, partly is the most GitHub allows.
    open     neither: nothing on GitHub stops the workflow being removed before the merge.

Source, read 2026-10-10: the rule is only in the Enterprise Cloud edition of GitHub's "Available rules for rulesets",
set "at the organization or enterprise level"; the Free, Pro and Team edition has no such rule:
