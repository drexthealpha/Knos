"""The workflow-strip hole, read from GitHub: can the buyer remove the Knos workflow before merging?

A buyer who controls a repository can delete or edit the Knos workflow in the merging pull request itself, so the
check that would have refused the work never runs. What closes it is GitHub's, not Knos's:

    closed   a ruleset requires the Knos workflow (a `workflows` rule: "Require workflows to pass before merging",
             organization rulesets on GitHub Enterprise Cloud). The workflow runs from the file the rule pins, not the
             pull request's copy. Closed only for people who cannot edit or bypass that ruleset: an organization
             owner (for an organization ruleset) or a repository admin (for a repository one) can still remove it.
    partly   a required status check names a Knos check (rulesets or classic branch protection). The merge waits for
             a check of that name, but a pull request can change the workflow that produces it, and an admin can
             remove the requirement.
    open     neither: nothing on GitHub stops the workflow being removed before the merge.

GitHub's API: GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/rules/branches/{branch} (every active rule on the branch, from repository and
organization rulesets, each with `ruleset_source_type`), GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets/{id} (its
`bypass_actors`, shown only to those with write access to the ruleset), GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/{branch}
(classic protection). Rule shapes: docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/rules. `knos protect --check-strip OWNER/REPO`."""
