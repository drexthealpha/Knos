"""The acceptance receipt: one JSON document that says who signed what, about which artifact, under which terms, and
what was paid for it. It is derived from public facts only (the order, the judge's signed token, the program's
log lines of the paying transaction), so anyone can rebuild it and compare digests. docs/RECEIPT.md is the
specification; docs/receipt/acceptance-receipt.v2.schema.json (and v1) is the JSON Schema; docs/receipt/vectors.json
holds the conformance vectors.

Version 3 keeps five things apart, in this order: what the issuer authenticated, what the evaluator observed, which
policy produced the verdict, who authorised the money and under which limit, and what trust remains; it records who
controls each judge that spoke, and it lists every amendment of the order's terms with its transaction. Version 2 has
four of the parts (no commercial authorisation, no record of the judges' control) and version 1 none; both still
check (`check` reads all three), `upgrade` writes a version 1 receipt as version 2 and `build3` a version 2 one as 3.

Version 4 says the verdict in one of four words (accepted, rejected, insufficient evidence, disputed), names the
deliverable, the evaluation, the invoice line and the settlement by ids of their own (knos.ids), names its evidence
source, and lists its `limitations`: what this evidence does not show. A receipt of a run that was rejected or could
not tell is a valid receipt and says so; only an accepted one authorises payment (`authorises_payment`). `build4`
writes a version 3 receipt as version 4, `unpaid4` a receipt of a run nothing was paid for, `dispute` a contested one.

`check` is the whole rule set (the schema's shape and the rules a schema cannot say: shares add up, amounts add up,
the judge matches the order). It needs no package. `render` is the receipt for a person, under the five headings.
`mirror_write` / `mirror_find` keep receipts off chain (devnet can be reset); `attest` writes one as a Solana
Attestation Service attestation and never raises."""
