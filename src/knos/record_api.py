"""A supplier's record as a machine-priced API: pay, then the JSON (examples/record_api, docs/X402.md "Record").

    knos record serve      (python -m knos.record_api) a small server anyone can run. Knos hosts none.

    GET /records/<slug>.json    the record file, free, as it always was
    GET /lookup/<slug>          0.10 test USDC a lookup, paid through the proposed x402 "knos-order" scheme
    GET /orders/<order>         how many lookups an order has bought and used
    GET /health                 whether it can answer, whether it signs, and what its operator promises (nothing)

What the paid answer adds to the free file (knos.record_answer, docs/RECORD.md section 5): the operator's signature
over the record's hash, the time and slot the chain was read and an expiry (`knos record verify` checks it with no
network); a summary computed the same way for every supplier; and the supplier's history, field by field, only to a
reader the supplier granted (header Record-Grant). Without a grant the answer says "not granted". With no signing
key the answer says it is unsigned. Revenue from lookups is budgeted at zero until someone buys one.

The payment is a Knos work order, as in examples/x402_attested: the caller funds an order in escrow and names it. Two
things differ, and both come from the program as it is:

    the smallest order knos_pay takes is 5.00 (ORDER_MIN_AMOUNT), so one order buys fifty lookups (PACK), not one;
    an order's address is public, so naming it proves nothing: each call is signed by the wallet that funded the order
    over "knos-record:<order>:<n>:<slug>", where n counts that order's lookups from 0.

A call whose n was already served is a replay and is refused; so is a call another wallet signed.

WHO MAY CALL WHAT (ROUTES). Only GET; any other method is 405, any other path 404. Every route is public by design
except /lookup, which needs the payment above. Each client (its address) has a token bucket: RATE requests a second,
BURST at once (`--rate`, `--burst`); past it, 429 with Retry-After. Every input is checked before anything is read:
the path's length and characters, a slug's charset, an order's address, each header's size and its JSON's shape; a
bad one is 400 with one line saying why. No answer carries a stack trace: an unforeseen error is a 500 with one line;
`--debug` or KNOS_DEBUG=1 prints the trace to the operator's terminal, never to the caller. The server keeps the
count of each order in the memory engine (knos.proof.history's store) when it is given one, so a restart does not
sell a lookup twice. The escrow pays the server when the order's pinned judge signs an acceptance (PayOrder), or
returns everything to the caller after the deadline (RefundOrder). No judge for a lookup is built: docs/X402.md says so.

Standard library at import; solders and knos.settle.v2.pay when a payment is checked.
