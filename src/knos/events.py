"""One log of events under every recording mode: what was already counted, said in one place.

Knos records work in several modes: one evaluation in one transaction (`record`), a month's evaluations under one
Merkle root (`batch`), a paid order or bounty (`settle`), an invoice set against GitHub's record (`shadow`), and a
file somebody hands over (`import`). Each mode refuses its own repeats. None of them sees the others: a batch root
commits to a set and says nothing about a single record made the week before. This module is where they meet.

    Event       one thing that happened, with an id derived from WHAT it is (knos.ids), never from when or how it
                arrived. Kinds: evaluation, acceptance, invoice_line, settlement, correction, acknowledgement.
    Log         an append-only file of events, JSON Lines, each line canonical (knos.ledger.canon) and carrying the
                sha256 of the line before it. `read` recomputes the chain: a removed, reordered or edited line is found.
    ingest      THE one way in, for every mode. An id the log has not seen is appended and counted. The same id with
                the same content from another source is appended as a repeat (`first` names the line that counts), so
                it is counted once and both sources stay on record. The same id with different content is a conflict:
                refused, reported, and not written. The very same arrival twice (a retry) changes nothing.
    acknowledge the other party signs the log up to a head hash: a token of the issuer both already use (GitHub
                Actions, RS256, checked off line exactly as a `knosm:close:` token is) whose audience is
                `knosm:ack:<owner id>:<last line>:<head hash>`. A log in which that line no longer has that hash fails
                `read`. What was acknowledged is changed only by a later correction event.
    correction  an event that names another and says what it is now (a verdict, an amount, or void). Nothing is rewritten.
    statement   one month from the index (by month, by deliverable, by supplier) the log keeps as it grows: only that
                month's events are read, and a deliverable's other lines are found by key.
    export      a folder with the log, the acknowledgements, the keys, the index and every month's statement, and
                `check_export`, which rebuilds all of it from the log alone.
    gaps        what a root cannot say. A source numbers what it sends, per buyer, supplier and month, from 0; the
                number rides in `evidence` (`batch:` or `sent:`). `gaps` names the numbers that never arrived, and
                `close_problems` refuses a month over one unless a correction of the number itself (`gap:...`, void,
                with a reason) sits under a head a party signed. `across` names a deliverable billed or settled in
                more than one month: one deliverable id, ever.

What this proves and what it does not is in docs/EVENTS.md. In one line: uniqueness is enforced here and by both
parties' acknowledgements, not on chain.

Standard library only. The adapters import the module of their mode inside the function.
