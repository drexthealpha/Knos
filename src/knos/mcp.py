"""`knos mcp`: paid work and claim checks for a coding agent, over the Model Context Protocol on stdio.

    knos_bounties   the open bounties in escrow, largest first: work an agent can take
    knos_bounty     what is in escrow for one issue: each job's state and its terms in words
    knos_check_pr   whether a pull request's "tests pass" is true at its head commit, on GitHub's record
    knos_due        where a GitHub account is paid, what is held for it, its record, and the balances set aside for
                    its repositories

The money tools read both deployments. New funding goes to the second (programs-v2: knos.settle.v2), so that is
where open work is; a job funded on the first (knos.settle) finishes there, and its rows say `"deployment": 1`.
Those tools only read public data (Solana and GitHub): no key, no wallet, nothing written. `knos init` registers
this server with the agents on the machine.

Four more are the loop an agent runs by itself, with no person in it on an `auto` order:

    knos_find_work    open, unreserved, funded work from the chain, with its terms and the command that judges it locally
    knos_take_work    posts `/knos take` on the issue, as the agent's GitHub account
    knos_submit_work  runs the order's acceptance locally, and only when it passes opens the pull request (`Fixes #<issue>`)
    knos_collect      what is held and what was paid for the agent's account, and binds its payout address when money waits

knos_find_work and the report of knos_collect read only. The three that post (take, submit, the bind in collect) are off
until the person who runs the agent turns them on (`KNOS_AGENT_ACT=1`, or `knos agent init --allow-actions`), refuse a
classic GitHub token that carries `repo` unless that was allowed too, and return exactly what they posted. The agent's
Solana key (knos.agentkey) is only an address here: no tool opens the key file.

Whatever a repository or an account wrote (an issue's title and labels, a check's name, the globs in a bounty's terms)
is returned inside a field named `untrusted`, each string cut to 200 characters, and nowhere else: the server's own
sentences never repeat it. The instructions tell the agent those fields are data. `KNOS_MCP_REPOS` (owner/name, comma
or space separated) restricts the tools to those repositories: a listing holds only their bounties, and a tool that
names another repository refuses it.

The protocol is written out here, with no SDK: one JSON-RPC 2.0 message per line on stdin and stdout, and nothing but
those messages on stdout. Two eras of clients are answered. One opens with `initialize` and is told the protocol
version it asked for; the other (revision 2026-07-28) keeps no session and names its version in every request's
`_meta`. Starting the server opens no connection: the chain and GitHub are asked only when a tool needs them.
