"""One signed transaction sent to more than one endpoint, sent again until an endpoint takes it, and confirmed by its
signature, in ONE status request for every transaction the process waits on.

The 0.3.24 burst on devnet paid 22 of 40: the other 18 were turned away by the public endpoint (dropped connections,
timeouts, HTTP 408), each a payment whose ONE send's answer never came. A transaction's signature is its identity: the
same signed bytes land at most once, however often and wherever they are sent. So `FanLedger` (a `knos.chain.Ledger`)

  * sends each signed transaction to the configured endpoint and to every second endpoint it is given, the first with
    preflight (a failing program still answers with its logs, and costs no fee), the others without;
  * takes a dropped connection, a timeout, HTTP 408, 429 or 5xx as no answer, never as a refusal;
  * sends the same bytes again every RESEND_EVERY polls (2 s) while NO endpoint has taken them (every send so far had
    no answer). An endpoint that took them forwards them to the leaders itself, "every two seconds until either the
    transaction is finalized or the transaction's blockhash expires" (https://solana.com/docs/advanced/retry: no
    maxRetries is given), so they are not sent to it again;
  * reads the status of every signature the process waits on at these endpoints in ONE getSignatureStatuses (BATCH a
    request), at most once a poll round whoever waits (`_Board`): forty payments at once ask one request a poll, not forty;
  * raises TimeoutError("... not confirmed ...") after POLLS polls (60 s: a blockhash is taken for about 60 to 90
    seconds, https://solana.com/docs/core/transactions/confirmation#how-does-transaction-expiration-work), or once that
    time and WAIT_SLACK_S more have passed on the clock whatever the polls, so the caller may sign again over a fresh
    blockhash.

Why the last three are so: the first 0.3.25 burst on devnet (10 October 2026) asked each transaction's status every
0.5 s and sent its bytes again every 2 s whatever an endpoint had answered. Forty payments at once asked about 80 status
requests a second of an endpoint that takes 40 of one method per 10 seconds; it answered every one with 429, each poll
waited out `chain.call`'s back-off (up to 15 s) while the wait was counted in polls, and 11 of 40 were paid in 23
minutes before the run was stopped.

Solana publishes ONE public devnet endpoint, https://api.devnet.solana.com, rate limited to 40 requests per 10 seconds
per IP for one RPC method (https://solana.com/docs/references/clusters). No second public one is named there, so by
default there is none and the fan-out is the resend to the one endpoint; KNOS_RPC_SECOND (comma-separated URLs) names
more, e.g. a provider's devnet endpoint of the operator's own. Counted by poll, so a test's stand-in clock and
endpoints give the same answer every run; the clock only cuts short a wait whose polls the endpoint slowed down."""
