"""One plain answer to a claim of payment where nothing was funded (.github/workflows/claims.yml runs this).

Knos pays one thing: an order funded with `/knos fund`, on Solana devnet, in test USDC, to the Solana address or the
passkey its payee bound. Pull requests arrive that claim a payment anyway: they carry the commands of bounty
platforms (`/claim`, `/attempt`, `/opire try`), or a wallet address on another chain, against an issue nobody
funded: sometimes against an issue that is not a task at all, such as the one the relay writes its log in. Left
unanswered, that reads as a debt. This module answers it once, in words that accuse nobody:

    python -m knos.claim_guard --event "$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH" --event-name "$GITHUB_EVENT_NAME"
    python -m knos.claim_guard --sweep          # every open issue and pull request (the timer: see claims.yml)

Since 0.3.19 the always-on worker runs the same sweep (`sweep_served`, called by every pass of
`knos.proof.ghrelay.once`): at most once in SWEEP_EVERY seconds for each repository it may write to, through the
worker's own conditional reader, so a listing with nothing new is a 304. GitHub's timer is a fallback: in the 0.3.18
release run claims.yml's 15-minute schedule did not fire once in 38 minutes.

What it does, and all it does: one comment (found again by its hidden first line, so a second event posts nothing)
and the label `no-order`. It closes nothing. It answers nothing written by the owner, a member, a collaborator or a
bot, and nothing when any issue the claim is about holds money on chain (the check is flow.py's own:
`knos.flow.funded`). When the chain does not answer it says nothing: not knowing is not "there is none". The one exception
is an issue that is a log (labels `knos-relay`, `knos-memory`; the titles those issues are made with): a log is not
a task whatever the chain says about its number.

NOTHING THE CLAIMANT WROTE REACHES THE COMMENT. The text is the constants below and issue numbers: integers this
repository's own API confirmed are issues. No title, no login, no address, no line of the claim is quoted, so
markdown, a mention or a very long body in a claim cannot put a word into what this repository says.
