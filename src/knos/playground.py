"""The playground: one public repository of Knos's where an account that cannot write to it may fund a test task.

Everywhere else `/knos fund` is for someone who can write to the repository (knos.flow._can_write). In the playground
the money is the devnet faucet's free test USDC, minted for the funding and withdrawn by nobody, so the only thing a
stranger can spend is Knos's patience. What bounds that is here, and knos.flow asks it before it asks GitHub to sign:

    where     only REPO, only while its owner is OWNER_ID (a repository of that name under another account is not it),
              only on devnet
    how       only in the description of an issue the account opens (`issues: opened`): one funding for one issue. A
              `/knos fund` comment from an account that cannot write is refused as it is everywhere
    how much  at most MOST for one task (the faucet itself gives at most pay.FAUCET_CAP for one funding)
    how often at most PER_DAY issues opened by one account in one UTC day, counted from GitHub's own list of that
              account's issues there; and the program's own rule, one faucet use per repository per minute
              (FUND_PERIOD), which holds whoever asks
    what      an issue numbered at most SLOTS: the repository holds the starter task's acceptance checks for those
              numbers (scripts/small_repos.py writes them), and a task with none could only be paid by a merge

`refuses` returns the reply to post, or "" when the funding may go on. It reads GitHub once and the chain never.
