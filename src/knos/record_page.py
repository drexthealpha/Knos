"""A supplier's public record, the badge it gives, and the receipt a supplier sends with an invoice.

    knos record build <supplier>      writes docs/records/<slug>.json (docs/RECORD.md): what is on record for one agent
                                      builder, agency or vendor, each figure with its sample, period and category
    knos badge record <slug>          an SVG from that file, and the Markdown that links it to the record's page
    knos record receipt <receipt>     one PDF page and its JSON for an acceptance receipt (docs/RECEIPT.md): what was
                                      agreed, delivered and accepted, by which evaluator, the evidence, how to check it

    python -m knos.record_api         the same files behind a paid lookup, 0.10 test USDC a call (knos.record_api,
                                      examples/record_api): a server anyone can run, and Knos hosts none. Its answer
                                      adds a signature with an expiry, a summary, and the history a supplier grants
                                      (knos.record_answer); this file stays free and unsigned

A record has two parts, kept apart and each labelled with where it came from:

    orders    work settled through Knos. Counted from the events log (knos.events: deliverables accepted, rejected,
              left with insufficient evidence, disputed, reverted by a correction) and from the supplier's memory in
              the Sibyl engine (knos.proof.history `supplier_record`, `appeals`: pull requests accepted and rejected
              under funded orders, appeals, rejections overturned). Every count lists the evidence behind it.
    public    for an agent the Agent PR Index measures, its row (docs/index.json): from public pull requests, not from
              Knos orders. The interval and the dispute link stay beside the rate.

Nothing here is a score, and nothing here reads a payment to Knos: the supplier never pays for a record and cannot
pay to change one. The file is not signed; the evidence each count links to is (docs/RECORD.md says which).

Standard library only at import: the script that writes the index (scripts/agent_pr_board.py) imports this module.
