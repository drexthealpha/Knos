"""The contract floor of a Plan, which the program does not enforce, enforced by the only Knos tool that signs one.

knos_pay lets FEE_OWNER set a Plan (SetPlan, instruction 14) for one repository owner's orders at 10 to 30 basis points
(`PLAN_BPS_MIN` = 10 in programs-v2/knos_pay/src/lib.rs). The price book's floor is 0.20%: the earlier 0.10% tier is
withdrawn. So: the program allows 10 bps; Knos signs no Plan below 20 bps; the check proves which Plans exist.

    build(...)        the SetPlan instruction, refused below FLOOR_BPS: the one Knos builder of SetPlan for a cluster
    plans(call)       every Plan account of knos_pay on a cluster: one getProgramAccounts, filtered by the Plan's length
                      (24 bytes), each checked to be the ["plan", owner id] address it says it is
    below(found, now) the Plans in force below the floor
    `knos fees plans [--check]` prints them; with --check it exits 1 when one in force is below 20 bps.

A Plan account (fund.rs `set_plan`): byte 0 version (1), byte 1 bump, bytes 2..4 the rate (u16), 8..16 the owner id
(u64), 16..24 the expiry (i64, unix seconds); all little-endian. An expired Plan charges the standard rate."""
