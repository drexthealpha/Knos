"""The test USDC faucet: `/knos faucet <Solana address | passkey>` on the playground's faucet issue.

A stranger who wants to fund a task in a repository of their own holds no test USDC. This gives them a small fixed
amount of it, on Solana devnet. Test USDC has no monetary value, and every reply says so.

    python -m knos.faucet --event "$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH"      # what the worker runs for one comment
    knos faucet request <address>                            # the line to post, and where
    knos faucet status                                       # what the journal on this machine holds

THE RULES, all of them (docs/FAUCET.md says the same):

    where       only on an issue labelled LABEL in knos.playground.REPO, while its owner is the playground's owner
    how much    AMOUNT (20 test USDC), one fixed amount
    how often   once per forge account per PERIOD (7 days), and once per receiving address per PERIOD
    daily cap   DAY_CAP (200 test USDC) in one UTC day, for everyone together. Circle's devnet faucet, the one source
                of this money, gives 20 USDC every 2 hours per address (https://faucet.circle.com/): 240 a day at most
    who         the anti-drain rule, from the one public call GET /users/{login}: a person's account (type User),
                opened at least MIN_AGE_DAYS (30) days ago, with at least MIN_PUBLIC (1) public repository or gist
    from what   the faucet key holds test USDC and nothing else: no SOL. It signs the transfer; the relay's key pays
                the transaction fee and the receiving account's rent. `DevnetChain` refuses to start when the faucet
                key is the fee payer, the fee owner or the guardian

TWO RUNS AT ONCE SEND ONCE. The worker runs one faucet job at a time (its concurrency group). Should two overlap all
the same, the pre-posted signature is the lock: each run posts its pending reply, then reads the issue again, and a run
that finds an EARLIER reply of the faucet's own for the same account or address sends nothing (`grant`, `held`).

JOURNALED: A RETRY NEVER SENDS TWICE. A grant is a row in the Sibyl store (knos.proof.history, category CATEGORY):

    pending     written BEFORE anything is signed. Then the transfer is signed, and its signature and the last block
                height it can land in are written to the row and to the faucet's own reply on the issue BEFORE it is
                sent. A row counts against every limit from this moment
    sent        the cluster confirmed that signature
    void        the transfer failed on chain and moved nothing; it counts against no limit

A run that finds a pending row (the same comment again, or a new comment by the same account) sends nothing new while
the journaled signature can still land: it asks the cluster about that signature. Landed: sent. Not landed and the
block height is past `last_valid`: that transfer can never land, so one new transfer is signed, journaled the same
way and sent. A runner keeps no disk between runs, so the journal travels in the faucet issue: every reply ends with
one hidden line (`MARK`), and `restore` reads the rows back from the replies the workflow's own account wrote.

NOTHING THE REQUESTER WROTE REACHES A REPLY except their address, which is base58 that decodes to 32 bytes.
