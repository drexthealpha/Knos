"""Completeness: a statement set against the sources it names, and every difference listed as an exception.

Two ledgers that agree with each other can both miss the same event. So a statement is also compared with the
sources themselves: the orders the chain holds and paid in the period, and the GitHub pull requests and workflow runs
its lines name. What does not match is never fixed in place; it is listed, one exception per difference:

    deleted      a line names a pull request or a run that GitHub no longer has: the line is held
    omitted      the chain paid an order in the period and no line of the statement bills it
    late         the chain paid an order in the period, but the record saw it after the period closed: it is carried
                 to the next period, never added to this one; a line that bills it anyway is held
    duplicated   one deliverable under two ids (two lines, or two orders, naming the same pull request or order):
                 counted once, the others flagged and left out of the count

    check(st, sources, store, terms, supplier)  the report: exceptions, what is counted once, what is carried
    remember(store, exc, resolution, ...)       how an exception was resolved, kept in the buyer's memory through
                                                knos.proof.history (Sibyl); `check` recalls it when the same source
                                                comes back. NullStore keeps and recalls nothing.
    contradictions(st, status)                  records of one line that cannot all be true (paid under two ids;
                                                booked from a transaction that was not final)
    stored_terms(data)                          what an order account funded earlier holds: its amount, its fee and
                                                its rate, which an upgrade of the program does not rewrite
