"""The audit export: everything one organisation's money paid for, for the person who approves the invoice.

`knos audit export --owner <org> [--from --to] --format csv|json` and `knos audit verify <file>` write and check the
statement. `knos audit show <order>` prints one deliverable as four linked objects (authorisation, acceptance,
commercial record, settlement status), `knos audit owed --payee <login>` is the supplier's side, and
`knos audit export --format netsuite|sap|coupa|quickbooks|generic` writes the files of knos.exports.

Version 2 of the file (this one) lists the bounties on issues (the second escrow's jobs, `knos2:` lines) beside the
work orders (`knos3:` lines): `record` says which a line is. A version 1 file listed work orders only, so an
organisation that had only posted bounties got an empty one. Version 2 also adds `source`, `terms_version`,
`paid_each` and `held_until`. The file names its version in its first line (CSV) or in `version` (JSON), and `verify`
checks a file of either version by that version's columns.

Everything is recomputed from the second escrow's own log lines (knos.records: `events_of`, `orders_of`), never from a
database and never from an account's state today. So the file is a function of the chain and the period alone: two
parties who export the same owner and the same period get the same bytes, and compare one hash (the head) instead of
the file. Nothing is asked of GitHub: accounts and repositories are their numeric ids.

One row is one LINE of an order: a payment (one paying transaction, all its payees), a holdback released after its
warranty, a kill fee, a refund, a revert, or `open` / `held` for an order nothing has happened to by the end of the
period. Events after the last day (`--to`) are not read at all: the file says what was true at the end of that day.

    seq, date, time           the line's number in this file, and the UTC day and time of its transaction
    kind                      paid, released, kill, refunded, reverted, open, held
    record                    order (a work order) or bounty (a bounty on an issue). A bounty has no holdback, no
                              revert, no kill fee and one payee; those cells are 0 or empty on its lines
    order                     the order's address; funded_transaction says which funding of that address (an address
                              is used again once an order is closed)
    owner_id, funder          the Balance's owner (0: none), and gh:<id> or wallet:<address>; commenter_id: who funded by comment
    source                    the address the money came from: the Balance, or the wallet that funded
    authorised_by             who had authority over the money, and in which role, as the program found at funding:
                              `gh:<id> (owner)`, `gh:<id> (spender)` (an id the Balance's owner had listed),
                              `gh:<id> (faucet)` (test money any commenter spends), or `wallet:<address>` (knos.controls.authority_of)
    repository_id, issue      what was commissioned (0 and 0 for a private order: its line on chain names neither)
    private, standing, mode   1 or 0; 1 or 0 (a standing offer pays once per pull request); merge or tests
    price_units, price        what the order holds for its payees; funder_fee_units: what its funder put in on top
    currency                  "test USDC" (devnet money, never real), or `mint <address>`
    terms_hash                sha256 of the terms JSON the funding logged: the policy the order was accepted under
                              (empty for a private order: its terms are a hash in the order account, not in a log line)
    terms_version             the `v` of that terms JSON (empty when the log does not carry the terms)
    pull_request, artifact    the pull request the paying line names, and the artifact as the log gives it:
                              `pull:<repository id>#<number>`, and `commit:<sha>` on a revert (the only line that prints one)
    supplier_ids, wallets     who supplied: every GitHub id paid in this transaction, and where (`;` between several)
    paid_each                 what each of them received, in the order of supplier_ids (`;` between several)
    judge, evaluator          who evaluated: the rule of the program that accepted the signed token (JUDGES)
    verdict                   accepted, pending, expired (no accepted work by the deadline), reverted, none (a kill fee)
    paid_units, paid          what reached the suppliers in this line. A work order's fee is paid by its funder on top
                              (funder_fee_units); a bounty's fee is taken out of its price, so price = paid + fee
    held_units                what the order still holds after this line (a holdback in warranty; an order held for a wallet)
    held_until                until when: the end of a holdback's review window, of a hold for a wallet, or an open
                              order's deadline (empty when the log does not say)
    refunded_units, reverted_units   what went back to the funder: at the deadline, or on a revert inside the warranty
    fee_units, fee            the fee and tip this line's transaction took
    transaction               its signature
    billing_key               order:funded transaction:milestone, on a paid line. The milestone of a standing order is
                              the pull request (the program pays one once: ["done", order, pr]); any other order has one: 0
    billed_before             1 when an earlier line of this file has the same billing key. The program refuses that,
                              so 1 is a finding, and `verify` fails on it
    exception, resolved_by    what was not the plain path (cancelled, reverted, arbiter ruling, kill fee, held for a
                              wallet, refunded after a part was paid) and whose act the program required for it
    prev                      the hash of the row before (the first row's is the hash of the file's scope)

A row's hash is sha256 of its canonical JSON (every column as text, keys sorted). The file ends with the totals per
currency and the HEAD: the last row's hash. `verify` recomputes every hash, the totals and the head, so an edited,
removed, added or reordered row is found. What it cannot find: a file rewritten whole, hashes and all. That is what
the head is for: export the same period yourself and compare.

What the log does not say, and this file therefore does not: the commit of the workflows that signed (it is in the
order account while the order is open, and in the signed token of the paying transaction, which `transaction` names);
the head commit of an accepted pull request; names. A history the cluster did not give whole is refused unless
`--partial`, and then the scope says "partial" and the head is not one to compare.
The command reads the escrow's newest 1000 transactions at most (knos.records.read): an owner whose orders go further back
gets a partial file until the reader pages further.
