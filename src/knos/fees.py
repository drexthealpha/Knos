"""The fee knos_pay charges, in one place, and which of its two rules the cluster's program applies now.

    0.3.18 (knos_pay 2.2)   jobs and orders alike: 0.30% of the amount, at least 0.05 of a whole unit; one rate, no
                            tiers; a Plan lowers the rate to no less than 0.10%. The numbers are knos.settle.v2.pay's
                            (FEE_BPS, FEE_MIN, fee_of): nothing here types them again.
    0.3.14 (knos_pay 2.1)   an order: 2.5% of the first 1,000, 1% from there to 50,000, 0.5% above, at least 0.40; a
                            Plan lowers the first rate to no less than 0.5%. A job: 2.5%, at least 0.05.

The public programs charge the 0.3.14 fee until the upgrade to knos_pay 2.2 executes (a proposal of the upgrade
multisig, public for 48 hours first). So a fee shown to a person follows the build that is LIVE:

    version(ledger)   asks the program (Version, by simulation: `knos2:version 2` is 2.2), as knos.settle.v2.relay does
    feed_version(f)   the same answer from the upgrade feed (web/upgrades.json) for a page or a command that asks no chain
    rule(v)           NEW from 2 up, OLD below
    words(v)          the fee in one sentence; with v None (nobody was asked) it says both rules and what decides

An order's fee is taken when it is funded and held with it, so an order funded before the upgrade keeps the rate fixed
at its funding (KEEPS says so wherever the fee is stated).
