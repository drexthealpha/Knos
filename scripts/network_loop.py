"""The network loop, counted: does a new participant make Knos more useful to the ones already there?

    buyer adopts -> suppliers integrate -> a supplier reuses the integration with another buyer -> the acceptance
    format spreads -> the record improves decisions -> more buyers adopt

Each link has one counter here, and docs/MARKET.md, section 7, prints them. Three are read from the same job records
scripts/outsiders.py counts (its rules decide who is outside: `funder_of`, `payees_of`); the others are read from this
repository: the report files of reproductions/, and the counts a person keeps by hand in docs/facts.json.

    suppliers_two_buyers      outside payees paid by jobs of two or more different outside funders
    buyers_through_supplier   outside funders whose first paid job paid a supplier that a different outside funder
                              had already paid: the buyer arrived where a supplier already was
    repeat_buyers             outside funders with paid jobs in two or more different months
    receipt_implementations   software that is not Knos's and reads or writes the receipt format (by hand, with a link)
    decisions_from_record     buyers who say they chose or dropped a supplier on its record (by hand)
    reproductions_signed      report files in reproductions/ from a run in someone else's repository

A funder is unrelated to another when they are different accounts or wallets and neither is Knos's: nothing here can
see common ownership, so two accounts of one company would count as two. A larger log of events is not a network
effect, and none of these counts events.

Supplier reuse, the link a network effect needs (a supplier's second buyer costs less than its first), is counted
apart, under "reuse" (`reuse` below):

    suppliers_reused       outside suppliers whose record a second unrelated buyer read (a paid lookup, knos.record_api)
                           or whose work a second unrelated buyer paid
    onboarding_pairs       suppliers paid by two or more unrelated buyers whose first orders both say when they were
                           funded: the sample of the three times below
    onboarding_first_s     the median, over those suppliers, of the seconds from the first buyer's first funded order
                           to its first payment
    onboarding_second_s    the same for the second buyer
    onboarding_saved_s     the median of first minus second: what the second buyer saved. null with no pair

    python scripts/network_loop.py            prints the six and the reuse counts, as JSON, from an empty job list:
                                              the chain is not read here, and every count is 0 (times null)
    python scripts/network_loop.py --jobs jobs.json [--lookups lookups.json] [--own own.json]
                                              the same from job records (as scripts/outsiders.py reads them, with
                                              `funded_at` and `paid_at` in seconds) and from the record server's
                                              paid lookups ([{"reader": "wallet:<address>" | "gh:<id>",
                                              "supplier": "gh:<id>" | "wallet:<address>"}]): the script that moves them
