"""How long `knos decide` takes, measured here, and the table of it in docs/BENCH.md ("Decision time").

    python scripts/decide_bench.py            # measure and print
    python scripts/decide_bench.py --write    # and rewrite the block in docs/BENCH.md and the decision clock of docs/LOAD.md
    python scripts/decide_bench.py --tokens tokens.jsonl [--write]   # also on real tokens (scripts/replay_tokens.py --capture)

What is timed is `knos.decide.token` (the relay's own reads, `knos.settle.v2.relay.precheck`) followed by
`knos.decide.provisional`, from the moment the token is in hand to the provisional receipt. The chain is LiteSVM with
the committed test builds of the programs (tests/_pay2.py), so a read costs no network: this is the time Knos's own
code takes, on this machine. On a cluster every read of the chain adds a round trip to an RPC endpoint, and that is
NOT in these numbers and has not been measured.

    fresh       a token never seen: the issuer's signature is checked and the chain is read
    cached      the same question again through `knos.decide.Cached`: answered from what the chain said before
    no chain    `ledger=None`: the token alone (it can be rejected, never accepted)
    offline     `knos.decide.offline`: the signature against KEPT key lists, the claims and the terms; nothing read
    warm        the same through one `knos.decide.Decider` built before the token arrived: the rules loaded and the
                key lists read once. THIS is the row the 100 ms target is about: the decision once the evidence is there
    chain check `knos.decide.chain_check` and `after_chain`: one request to the (simulated) chain, then the answer
    free check  `knos.decide.checks`: the conclusions of the named checks, no token and no chain

Each row has its own n. p95 is by nearest rank. tests/test_decide.py runs the same measurement with fewer samples and
holds the two targets: a cached decision under 200 ms and evidence to decision under 2 s, both at p95. Both are
bounds on this machine with no network; neither is a claim about a cluster.

`cold(n)` times the whole command in a new process each time (`python -m knos.decide --token-file ... --no-chain`:
interpreter start, imports, the offline decision, the receipt written), and takes apart what the command says of
itself: "rules loaded in L ms" (paid once a process) and "offline A ms" (paid once a token). `streamed(n)` starts ONE
`python -m knos.decide --stream` and hands it n tokens: each line's own `ms`. `round_trips()` counts requests through
an endpoint that only counts: the relay's whole precheck (what `knos decide` asked of a cluster in 0.3.18) against the
one request of `chain_check`. `real(path)` decides on every token of a file `scripts/replay_tokens.py --capture`
wrote, with the key set of its day and the clock at its issue time; the tree holds no such file (a token is public,
but nobody committed one), so the release run makes it. The 100 ms figure in the table is a TARGET for the warm
offline decision, set in 0.3.20 (it was 250 ms); the figures beside it are what was measured.

`--write` also keeps what was measured in docs/bench.json (`decision.local`), beside the devnet sample of the last
release run (`decision.devnet`, entered from that run's report); scripts/latency_stages.py reads both.
