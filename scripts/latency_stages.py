"""Where the seconds of a payment went, stage by stage, and how many attempts did not go through the first time.

    python scripts/latency_stages.py [--events e.json] [--log comments.json] [--repo drexthealpha/Knos] [--rpc URL] [--json]

The headline wait (merge to paid: scripts/network_stats.py, measure()) says how long a person waited. This script
splits each of those payments with what the public relay log and GitHub already give, and nothing else:

    runner_queue   the merge (GitHub's merged_at)        -> the workflow run's start
    workflow       the run's start                       -> the token's comment
    relay_wait     the token's comment                   -> the relay picking it up
    first_send     pickup                                -> the block of the token's first transaction
    confirm        that block                            -> the block of the transaction that paid

`workflow`, `relay_wait` and the relay's own `chain` seconds (pickup to its last confirmation) are on the token's log
line (`workflow=`, `wait=`, `chain=`; `queue=` is the part of runner_queue that GitHub records as the run waiting for
a runner, printed beside it). runner_queue is what is left of the measured wait before the run began: the whole wait,
less workflow, relay_wait and chain. It also holds the time GitHub took to start the run at all, and a run that was
asked for again later. first_send and confirm split `chain` by the block times of the line's transactions; the log
names the last three of a token's transactions, so "first" is the first of those (`--rpc` reads their block times;
without it the two are left out and `chain` stands for both). A stage is measured only where the line carries it:
every stage prints its own n.

THE FIVE STATES. A payment is received, accepted, submitted, confirmed, finalized (docs/RELAY.md has the table), and
the second table says how long each state took to reach from the one before it:

    received    the merge                              -> the workflow run's start         (runner_queue: GitHub's)
    accepted    the run's start                        -> the token posted for a relay     (`workflow=`; ends at `queued_at=`)
    submitted   the token posted (`queued_at=`)        -> the relay's first send (`sent_at=`)
    confirmed   the first send                         -> the last confirmation (`confirmed_at=`)
    finalized   the last confirmation                  -> the cluster finalized it         (the settle comment's `knos-states`
                                                          line, when --log holds those comments too; no relay waits for it)

Since 0.3.16 every ok line carries queued_at, seen_at, sent_at and confirmed_at, whoever relayed. A payment whose line
has none of them (an older line), or whose relay sent nothing itself (`sent_at=-`: someone else carried it first), is
NOT in that table and is NOT dropped: it is listed under it, by token, with its whole wait.

Then the attempts (network_stats.attempts): the payments asked for, the ones that completed, the lines that failed,
the ones that took more than one try, the ones completed only after a failed line. That is "successful completion
across all attempts, including interrupted ones". The log holds what a relay answered: a token no relay picked up
has no line.

THE SIX STAGES, ONE TABLE (`--md` prints it alone, as Markdown; the JSON report carries it as `six`). The same
measurements under the names a reader asks for, each with its own n, p50 and p95:

    workflow scheduling   the merge                      -> the workflow run's start        (runner_queue)
    evaluation            the run's start                -> the token's comment             (workflow)
    relay pickup          the token's comment            -> a relay taking it up            (relay_wait)
    submission            pickup                         -> the first transaction's block   (first_send; needs --rpc)
    confirmation          that block                     -> the paying transaction's block  (confirm; needs --rpc)
    finality              the last confirmation          -> the cluster finalized it        (the settle comment's line)

A stage no line recorded prints "not recorded" in every cell. Nothing is filled in from another stage or guessed.

THE FIVE CLOCKS (`--clocks` prints the table; the JSON report carries it as `clocks`; docs/LOAD.md has it). The six
stages are one wait cut in six. A reader who asks "how fast is it" asks about five different clocks, and only one of
them is Knos's own to shorten:

    work execution               the forge starts a runner and runs the job    workflow scheduling, evaluation
    evidence availability        the signed token reaches whoever acts on it   relay pickup
    Knos decision processing     the token in hand -> accepted or not          `knos decide` (scripts/decide_bench.py:
                                                                               measured on one machine, no network; on
                                                                               devnet 4.3 to 32.6 s, four runs of 0.3.18)
    chain inclusion              the first send -> the paying transaction at   submission, confirmation; and finality,
                                 the commitment level `confirmed`              which is the level `finalized`
    bank availability            not applicable: no bank route                 nothing: Knos pays test USDC on devnet

Every row carries its own n and says where it was measured. A clock nothing measured says so. No row is a sum of
two others: percentiles of different samples do not add.

THE SIX LATENCIES, EACH ON ITS OWN (`--separate`; 0.3.20; docs/BENCH.md, "Every latency, apart"). The names a buyer
asks by, and no row is a sum of others:

    evidence arrival      the merge -> the run's start, and the token's comment -> a relay holding it (two rows: two samples)
    evaluation            the run's start -> the token's comment (the judging job, and the forge's signature)
    decision              the token in hand -> the provisional receipt (`knos decide`: scripts/decide_bench.py here,
                          and the last release run's sample on devnet; docs/bench.json `decision`)
    chain confirmation    pickup -> the first transaction's block -> the paying transaction's block, at `confirmed`
    finality              the last confirmation -> the cluster finalized it
    payout                the paying transaction IS the payout (test USDC into the payee's token account): nothing
                          comes after it to time. To a bank: not applicable, there is no bank route

    python scripts/latency_stages.py --separate --recorded             # from docs/bench.json: no network
    python scripts/latency_stages.py --separate --rpc URL --write      # THE RELEASE RUN'S ONE COMMAND: measures the live log
                                                                       # and chain, keeps it in docs/bench.json (`stages`)
                                                                       # and rewrites the block in docs/BENCH.md

At release time it runs against the live log and chain (GH_TOKEN for GitHub's rate limit; --events is what
`scripts/network_stats.py --events-out` wrote, else the chain is read). tests/test_latency_stages.py runs it on a
recorded sample.
