"""The relay's queue under load, on this machine: N entries, W workers, one worker killed and one slow confirmation.

    python scripts/queue_drill.py [--items 200] [--workers 4] [--lanes 20] [--seed 314] [--write]

This is a LOCAL TEST OF THE QUEUE (knos.settle.v2.relayq), not a benchmark of the service: nothing is signed, no
transaction is built and no cluster is asked. The chain is a stand-in that keeps the one rule the queue relies on, the
programs' single-use rule: a token is taken once, and a second send of it is answered "already" and moves nothing.
(That rule itself is tested on the programs as built: tests/test_relay_failures.py, on LiteSVM.) The clock is the
drill's own, so a lease expires when the drill says so and the result is the same on every run.

What is injected:

    a kill              one worker takes an entry and stops before it sends (the thread ends without an answer). The
                        entry stays leased until its lease expires; then another worker takes it.
    a slow confirmation one entry is held in flight, 60 s on the drill's clock, while twenty others are carried. The
                        entries behind it in its lane wait for it; the other lanes do not.

THE SWEEP ON THE QUEUE (`sweep`). The second part runs the relay's always-on pass itself, `knos.proof.ghrelay.once`,
which queues what it reads and carries it with the queue's workers: 12 tokens of 6 owners (two each) are posted, the
confirmation of one takes 60 s of the drill's clock, and one pass is killed after a token was sent and before
anything was noted. GitHub and the chain are stand-ins here too; the relay, its notes and the queue are the real ones.

What is counted: entries done and dead, sends per entry (every one must be 1), entries the chain took (each once),
entries that left out of order within their lane, and the entry taken again after the kill. `--write` puts the
result in docs/load.json (`relay.queue`) and renders docs/LOAD.md (scripts/load.py).
