"""A second outcome that is not code: SUPPORT RESOLUTIONS, counted by the meter under terms agreed before the work.

                                                offline: GitHub's signature, and that it signed exactly this count

THE DEFINITION (the terms file states it; its hash is the policy every evaluation names). A ticket is one accepted
resolution when all of these hold, read from the help desk's own record of the ticket:

  1. the agent marked it solved;
  2. no person took it over: no escalation and no reply by a human agent, up to the end of the window;
  3. the customer did not come back: no reopening and no further customer message inside the window after `solved`;
  4. the window has closed (terms `window_hours`, counted from `solved`). Until then the ticket has NO verdict and is
     not in the count: nothing is billed on a resolution that can still be undone;
  5. where the terms require it (`confirmation`: "required"), the customer said it was solved; with "or_silence" a
     customer who left without asking for more counts as well.

A ticket is one deliverable whatever number of times it is exported or judged: accepted and billed once. A reopening
after the window does not take the resolution back; it is a new deliverable only when the terms say so
(`new_after_window`), which is `knos.ledger.reopened`'s rule.

This mirrors how two vendors that bill per resolution publish their own count. Intercom counts a resolution when the
customer confirms or leaves without asking for more, does not count one when the customer asks for a person, takes it
back when the customer returns to the conversation, and bills a conversation at most once
(https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/8205718-fin-ai-agent-resolutions). Zendesk evaluates only conversations
that were not escalated, after a period of inactivity (72 hours for email and web forms), and counts per
conversation (https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5352026794010). Both read 7 October 2026.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT SHOW. The tickets are made up. The script reads a FILE: it does not read a help desk, and nothing
here proves that a file is a help desk's true record. Whether an answer was right is in no ticket state. LIMITATIONS
below goes into every receipt.
