"""The round `pause`: the guardian multisig stops new funding at the public knos_pay for PAUSE seconds
(scripts/governance.mjs `guardian pause`), one funding from the funder's wallet is held to the program's refusal
(error 96, E_PAUSED), and the pause is lifted at once (`guardian pause 0`). A pause also ends by itself, so a round
stopped half way leaves nothing paused for long. Payments, refunds, withdrawals and binds are never paused.
