"""Verified reproductions, by the account that owns the repository they ran in.

    python scripts/reproductions.py [--json] [--live] [FILE_OR_FOLDER ...]

Reads every file of reproductions/ (and any file, artifact .zip or folder given after it), verifies each as
`knos reproduce --verify` does (GitHub's signature against scripts/github_oidc_keys.json, offline; `--live` also reads
the keys GitHub publishes now), and lists the valid ones grouped by repository owner. A run of Knos's own (an account
of scripts/own_github_ids.json, or a repository of drexthealpha) is never listed: it is counted under `own`, apart.
A file that does not verify, or in which a check failed or none passed, is listed under `refused`, with why.

The count it prints is the outside reproductions count: owners, runs, and the wall time of each run (from the
workflow's first step to GitHub's signature, both signed; empty for a report made before 0.3.25). Standard library
only: it runs on a bare Python, as the check of a pull request does.
