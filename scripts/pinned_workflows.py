The source of truth is this repository: .github/workflows/fund.yml, prove.yml, check.yml and attest.yml, where they are
tested. A repository names them by a commit of drexthealpha/knos-workflows, and a bounty records that commit on chain.
That repository holds copies and nothing else: the four files, requirements/sign.txt, a short README and the LICENSE.

What crosses between jobs. In prove.yml and attest.yml the job that runs a pull request's code cannot sign, and the job
that signs runs none of it. One line of data crosses, and a step of the signing job reads it with a module of the very
release that job installed (`python -m knos.verdict_gate`). `check` holds every such step to a module and a command the
wheel has (`modules_run`).

What the jobs install, and why a release has an order. A job that signs, or holds a secret, installs from a list in
which every file is named by its sha256 (`uv pip install --require-hashes --no-deps --no-build`): every third-party
package (compiled with `uv pip compile --generate-hashes` from requirements/sign.in), and the knos wheel of the
release as the last line. That list is requirements/sign.txt here once a release is locked, it is written into the
install step of each such job, and it is published as requirements/sign.txt of the workflows' repository: the commit
of the workflows names the hash of everything those jobs install. The source workflows hold the word KNOS_LOCK where
the list goes; `build` writes it in, and a file that still says KNOS_LOCK installs nothing, so it cannot be published
by mistake.

The wheel's hash exists only once the wheel is built, and the commit of the workflows exists only once the list is in
them. So the wheel is built FIRST and ONCE, from the final tree, and nothing the wheel contains may name that commit:
src/knos never does, and README.md (the wheel's description on PyPI) is not a file `stamp` writes.

The jobs that sign nothing take knos from PyPI with a cutoff, UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER: uv takes no file uploaded after that
time, knos itself included. So the cutoff can only be written once PyPI has the wheel, and the workflows can only be
committed after that. `cutoff` asks PyPI when it took the locked wheel and writes that time plus MARGIN, with a note
naming the release and the time. Until the note names the release the workflows install, a locked tree publishes
nothing (`published`). 0.3.25 set its cutoff by hand to midnight; its wheel went up three hours later, and uv could
not see it. The order, which docs/RELEASE.md gives with every command (scripts/release.py runs it):

    1. Build the wheel once, reproducibly (`release.py wheel`): SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH fixed, the build backend pinned by
       hash. `lock WHEEL --write`: requirements/sign.txt gets the line `knos==X.Y.Z --hash=sha256:<this wheel>`.
       (`lock` refuses a wheel that is not the release the workflows name.)
    2. That wheel goes to PyPI (`release.py publish`). Then `cutoff`: UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER from the time PyPI took it.
    3. `build DIR` into a checkout of drexthealpha/knos-workflows and commit it there: its sha, S, is the one commit
       everything names; its tree is `tree`. Nothing signs from these workflows before this commit exists.
    4. `stamp S` here, then `check DIR`. The wheel built again from the stamped tree has the same hash (tested), so
       the ONE commit of the release holds the lock, the cutoff, the pin and the sources of the wheel at once. Then
       the push and the tag. release.yml uploads nothing to PyPI: it builds the wheel again, holds it to the locked
       hash, and fails unless PyPI serves a file with exactly that hash.
    A new third-party release changes nothing that is published: the list names what it names. Moving a dependency
    is a new requirements/sign.txt, a new release and the four steps again.

`stamp` replaces the placeholder KNOS_WORKFLOWS_SHA (or the commit named before) in examples/, in Knos's own knos.yml
and knos-check.yml, in docs/ and in the JavaScript client's README, and regenerates the site's templates (scripts/front_workflow.py writes
web/front.js from the examples). `check` says every place that disagrees.

The jobs that sign nothing (review and judge in prove.yml, and check.yml) install knos as the exact PyPI release they
name, with dependencies no newer than UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER (step 2). Before that release exists nothing can install it, so a staging
repository rehearses with --source: REQ is one requirement uv can install, such as
"git+https://github.com/drexthealpha/Knos@<commit>" or the URL of a wheel. The variant differs from the published
workflows in that requirement and in how the signing jobs get it: their list holds the third-party packages by hash
and knos is installed from REQ after it, which no hash can cover. Its README says what it is. It is for rehearsal
only: a bounty funded through it is pinned to the staging repository's commit, not to the published one.

{note}The workflows that [Knos](https://github.com/drexthealpha/Knos) bounties pin by commit. A comment funds an issue,
and the pull request that closes it is paid from an escrow on Solana when GitHub itself signs the facts. A bounty on
chain names this repository and one commit of it: the commit its `fund.yml` ran at. Only `prove.yml` of this
repository at that same commit can pay it.

| File | Called for | Runs |
|---|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/fund.yml` | a `/knos` comment, or a new issue that funds itself; in an organisation's attestor repository, a run by hand or a timer | `knos command` |
| `.github/workflows/prove.yml` | a merge, a run started by hand, `/knos settle`, and the review after the check; in an attestor repository, a timer | `knos settle`, `knos review`, `knos proof judge` |
| `.github/workflows/check.yml` | every pull request (optional, read-only) | `knos check` |
| `.github/workflows/attest.yml` | a seller, by hand, after a merge: GitHub signs that a work order's terms were met; a buyer, by hand: one evaluation for `knos_meter` (kind `eval`, posted as `knos-eval:`) | `knos attest` |

Call them by a full commit sha, never by a branch or a tag. The first three take no inputs; `attest.yml` takes a
repository, a pull request, an order, a kind and optional payees, which name facts and never code. Every job installs
{installs}, so a caller cannot change which code judges.

The jobs that sign (`fund.yml`, `settle` and `attest` in `prove.yml`, and `attest.yml`) install from a list in which every file is
named by its sha256, `uv pip install --require-hashes`: that list is written into the workflow and is also
`requirements/sign.txt` here, so this commit names the hash of everything they install.

The files to copy into your repository (`knos.yml`, and optionally `knos-check.yml`; for private repositories, `knos-attestor.yml` in one
repository of the organisation) are in
[drexthealpha/Knos/examples](https://github.com/drexthealpha/Knos/tree/main/examples). Their comments say what each
trigger does and what the file can and cannot do in your repository.

Nothing is edited here. These files are copied from `.github/workflows/` in drexthealpha/Knos at a release, where they
are tested. In a checkout of that repository, `python scripts/pinned_workflows.py check <a checkout of this one>`
shows that this copy is the same, byte for byte.
