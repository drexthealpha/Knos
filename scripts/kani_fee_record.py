"""Runs the Kani harnesses of programs-v2/fee_proofs and records what the solver answered in docs/kani.json, under
`fee_proofs` (the rest of that file, the run of programs-v2/knos_pay/src/proofs.rs, is not touched), and the same
summary under invariant 8 of docs/invariants.json. docs/INVARIANTS.md says it in words; tests/test_fee_proofs.py holds
the page's words to the record.

    python scripts/kani_fee_record.py --harness <name>   # run one harness alone, within the limit, and record it
    python scripts/kani_fee_record.py --all              # every harness of src/lib.rs, one after the other
    python scripts/kani_fee_record.py --check            # fail if the record is not about the source as it is now
    python scripts/kani_fee_record.py --ci               # every harness alone within its limit; writes nothing; a
                                                         # harness that fails or times out is named and the exit is 1

A harness marked `#[kani::solver(cvc5)]` is answered by cvc5 with bit-vectors solved as integers: this script puts
programs-v2/fee_proofs/solvers first on PATH for it, where `cvc5` is a script that runs the installed cvc5 (the next
one on PATH, or $KNOS_CVC5) with `--solve-bv-as-int=sum`. Every other harness is answered by Kani's default, CaDiCaL.

A harness is `verified` only when Kani printed VERIFICATION:- SUCCESSFUL with no failed check before the limit;
`timed out` and `failed` prove nothing. The record carries the hash of src/lib.rs (the harnesses) and of the program's
lines they are about (what build.rs copies out of knos_pay/src), so a change to either makes --check fail until the
harnesses are run again. `summary` is written from the results, never by hand: the words `verified` (one harness
over every amount is proved, or every part is), `verified but for one bound at one rate` or `not verified`, for the statement
"the fee is within its bounds for every amount an order may hold"; `parts` says which statement holds over which range.

    python scripts/kani_fee_record.py --program         # the harnesses of programs-v2/knos_pay/src/proofs.rs (180 seconds each): the top of the record
