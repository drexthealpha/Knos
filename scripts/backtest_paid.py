"""backtest_paid.py -- merged pull requests that were PAID a bounty on another platform, and whether a check had failed.

The buyer's loss in the buyer's own market: on Algora and Opire a maintainer pays a bounty when a pull request is
merged. A Knos bounty pays only when the checks its terms require passed at the head commit (src/knos/terms.py). So, of
the pull requests that were paid a bounty elsewhere, how many had a failed check at the commit that was merged?

    GH_TOKEN=... python scripts/backtest_paid.py                 # collect, read, count; write docs/backtest_paid.json
                                                                  # and the block of docs/BENCH.md
    python scripts/backtest_paid.py --days 270 --windows 9 --per-window 100

Until the release run executes this with a GitHub token, docs/backtest_paid.json says `"status": "not run"` and so does
the block of docs/BENCH.md: no number is made up, and none is carried over from another measurement.

How a bounty is marked on GitHub (read 3 Oct 2026; the first two are documentation, the rest is what the script assumes
and the release run checks):
  Algora  the label "💎 Bounty" is on an issue that has a bounty         https://remotion.dev/bounties
          the bot adds a bounty label and replies with how to claim       https://docs.algora.io/bounties/workflow
          a solver claims with `/claim #N` in the pull request's body     https://docs.algora.io/commands
          the sponsor pays from the organisation's page ("Reward")        https://docs.algora.io/bounties/workflow
  Opire   a reward is made with `/reward 100`, a solver claims with        https://github.com/FalkorDB/docs/issues/297
          `/claim #N`; the bot's text is "created a $X reward using        https://github.com/abdulmajeedsualihu/Autokey/issues/1
          Opire"; the bot posts about it in the issue                      https://docs.opire.dev/overview/install-bot
Neither platform's public documentation says what its bot writes on GitHub when a bounty has been PAID, and I found no
public list of Opire's labels. So the paid marker below is a rule, not a fact: a comment by the platform's bot that says
awarded, rewarded, paid or sent next to the pull request author's @login, on the issue or on the pull request. Every
record keeps the URL of the comment it relied on, so the release run is also the check of the rule, and a bounty issue
with a merged pull request and no such comment is counted as `unpaid`, not dropped.
