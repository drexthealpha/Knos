# Examples

Each line is one example: what it shows, and who it is for. Everything here runs on Solana devnet with test USDC,
which has no monetary value. Folders named `cheats/` and `near_misses/` are not examples: they are wrong submissions
that the tests run, to show that the checks refuse them ([docs/reference/TAMPER.md](../docs/reference/TAMPER.md)).
