 * `wallet`: { address, token, send(ix) -> signature, sign(message) -> bytes } (send signs and submits; sign is the wallet's ed25519). `limits`: { maxAmount, programs, mints, feeVersion }.
 * `feeVersion`: what the program answered to Version, when the client asked it (2: knos_pay 2.2 and its 0.30% fee; 1: knos_pay 2.1's tiered fee of 2.5% / 1% / 0.5%, at least 0.40).
 * Not given, the fee of either rule is accepted: the program takes its own, and `maxAmount` caps the price.
