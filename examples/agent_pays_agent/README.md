# Agent pays agent, only when the work is accepted

Knos turns any research into a product billions of people use, in days, not years.

Knos carries research across the valley of death, toward Kardashev II and III.

Two agents, each with its own key, and an evaluator that is not an agent. No AI model is called. The buyer's money
sits in held money that only a signed acceptance releases. `python -m pytest -q tests/test_agent_pays_agent.py` runs
both runs below in LiteSVM (a local Solana simulator) with the real program builds.

| who | file | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| buyer | `buyer.mjs` | reads the seller's board, picks a task within its limit, reads the `402`, funds the order, asks again |
| seller | `seller.mjs` | lists its task, sells it under `knos-order`, Knos's proposed scheme for x402 (paying over HTTP with status 402: [docs/reference/X402.md](../../docs/reference/X402.md)), delivers; `--wrong` delivers bad work |
| evaluator | `evaluator.mjs` | reads the task and the delivery; exit 0 is accepted, exit 1 is not |

Run 1: right work, the evaluator accepts, the payment program pays the seller the whole amount. Run 2: wrong work, no acceptance
is signed, another workflow's signature and an early refund are both refused, and at expiry the buyer gets the amount
and the fee back. The signature is GitHub's, over a run of the workflow the order pinned at funding, verified on chain
by `knos-oidc`; `evaluator.mjs` is the `test` check that run reads. In the test, a test key signs instead of GitHub.

On devnet, with test USDC. Nobody has done this devnet run yet. You need two key files: the payee must be an account
other than the funder, and `buyer.mjs` refuses a board whose payee is its own address.

    cp examples/agent_pays_agent/offer.devnet.json offer.json   # fill repoId, issue, seller.githubId, wfSha (the commit of the published workflows pinned in examples/knos-workflow.yml, on the branch workflows of drexthealpha/Knos)
    node examples/agent_pays_agent/seller.mjs --devnet --key seller.json --offer offer.json &
    node examples/agent_pays_agent/buyer.mjs --devnet --key buyer.json --board http://127.0.0.1:4021 --max 5000000
    node examples/x402_attested/live.mjs status --rpc https://api.devnet.solana.com --order ORDER
    node examples/x402_attested/live.mjs refund --rpc https://api.devnet.solana.com --key buyer.json --order ORDER

`buyer.json` needs a little SOL and 5.05 test USDC (5 for the order, a 0.05 fee) ([faucet.circle.com](https://faucet.circle.com)). `status` says
`paid` once the seller's pull request is merged with `test` green; in the `--wrong` run it stays `escrowed` and `refund`
returns everything after the offer's 15 minutes. Node 20 or later, no package to
install. Not built: an evaluator that is itself an agent holding a key the program trusts.
