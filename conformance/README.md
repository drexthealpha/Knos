# Knos conformance kit, version 4

Knos turns any research into a product billions of people use, in days, not years.

Knos carries research across the valley of death, toward Kardashev II and III.

Test vectors for Knos's formats, with expected results, and a runner that feeds them to any implementation:

    python conformance/run.py --impl "<the command that runs your implementation>"

- `manifest.json`: the kit's version, the formats, and the sha256 of each format's vectors.
- `vectors/`: the vectors of terms, ledger (formats 1 and 2), audiences, statement and ids. Receipt vectors live in `docs/receipt/`:
  `vectors.json` (receipt versions 1 to 3), `vectors.v4.json` (version 4: four verdicts, the four ids, limitations)
  and `vectors.v5.json` (version 5: the assurance level and the declared control relationships).
- Kit history: version 2 added receipt version 4 (`receipt4`) and `ids`. Version 3 added ledger format 2 (`ledger2`),
  the batch commitment that hashes each whole event (written by `make_ledger2.py`). Version 4 added receipt version 5
  (`receipt5`). No version changed an earlier vector.
- `run.py`: the runner and the protocol (one line of JSON in for each case, one line out). Python 3.10, nothing else.
- `impl/knos_python.py`, `impl/knos_js.mjs`: Knos's own Python and its JavaScript client, as two examples.

What each format is, what is promised about it and what is not: [docs/reference/CONFORMANCE.md](../docs/reference/CONFORMANCE.md).
