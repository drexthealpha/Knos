"""The Hold a key page (web/keyholder.js): tests/web/keyholder.mjs, run on web/ as it stands.

The node script first checks, on node's own WebCrypto, that the key the page makes is a Solana keypair file whose
address is its public half, and that the request it writes carries the public key only. In headless Chromium it then
makes a key in the page, saves its file, and reads the prefilled issue; shows what a browser with no Ed25519 is told;
and holds the page to twelve words a statement, to no sideways scroll, and to asking nobody but its own site. No node:
skipped. No `playwright` package or no browser: the first part still ran, and the test says the rest was skipped."""
