"""Every place in the four programs where a panic is written down: docs/UNWRAPS.md is made from this file.

A panic in a Solana program aborts the instruction and with it the whole transaction: the runtime keeps none of the
transaction's account changes, so no state is written and no token moves. What a panic costs is the fee and an error
that names no cause. The question for each place is therefore "can it be reached, and by whom", not "is money lost".

What is listed, for programs-v2/knos_{oidc,pay,meter,passkey}/src:
  - every `unwrap()`, `expect(`, `unreachable!`, `panic!`, `todo!`, `unimplemented!` and `assert` in program code,
    by file and line, with the reason it cannot fail or what happens when it does (WHY below: a place with no
    reason fails the test, and so does a reason that matches no place);
  - how many more are in unit tests and proof harnesses, which are in no build of a program;
  - for indexing (`d[a..b]`, `d[k]`), which panics out of range: the number of lines that index, by file. They are
    counted, not explained one by one.

    python tests/test_unwraps.py --write     # docs/UNWRAPS.md again, after a program's source changed

The test fails when the document is not what this file writes today: a new `unwrap()`, one that moved, or a file
that indexes on more or fewer lines, all change it.
