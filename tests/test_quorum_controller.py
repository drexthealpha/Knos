"""Two judges started by one account are one judge (docs/STANDARD.md, "Evaluators"; docs/CHARTER.md).

knos_pay 2.2 counts a quorum's judges by the owner of the repository each ran in. A person who starts runs in a
repository he owns and in one his organisation owns is two owners to the program and one controller in fact. The
relay refuses to carry the word that would complete such a quorum (knos.settle.v2.order_auto.controllers): the
refusal is off chain, and a program upgrade would make it the rule. Under 2.1 a marker names no run, so nothing can
be compared; the 2.1 build is not exercised here."""
