"""The approver's screen (web/approver.js): tests/web/approver.mjs, alone and with its page.

Alone, the node script holds the screen's rows to the statements of tests/data/statement, which `knos statement make`
wrote: the four line states, the line billed on an earlier statement (replayed), and the line that takes the agreed
sum past the purchase order the invoice file names (worked out by the page, as advice). With `page` it opens the
screen in headless Chromium and makes a first invoice comparison the way someone new would, timing each step; then
the sample, a receipt's five parts in place, the keyboard alone, 320 to 1280 px, twelve words a statement, no movement
when none is asked for, nobody asked but the page's own host. No node, no `playwright` package or no browser: skipped,
with the reason."""
