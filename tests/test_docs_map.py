"""docs/README.md is the front map: the seven pages a stranger reads first, each on it once, and nothing else in docs/*.md.
docs/reference/README.md is the map of every other document: every file in docs/reference/*.md is on it once, under one
of six questions, and every link on either map leads to a file. docs/STORY.md and web/story.js tell the three-minute
demonstration in seven beats, each with evidence that exists in the repository; what follows the last beat is an
invitation and claims nobody. docs/reference/MANIFEST.md is what scripts/release_manifest.py writes from its sources."""
