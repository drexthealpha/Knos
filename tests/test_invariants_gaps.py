"""The six guarantees of docs/INVARIANTS.md that had no test of their own (knos_pay 2.1 in LiteSVM):

  4. a pay or fund token of one deployment is refused by the same build at other program ids;
  5. every ordering of two and of three of pay, cancel, expiry, refund, settle, release and revert, from an order that
     pays at once, one that is held and one with a holdback, ends the order exactly once, as a small model says
     (after the orderings, time runs out and the one instruction that still takes each order is sent);
  6. RefundOrder on the committed build with real-money rules, sent by a stranger, with funding paused;
  7. two relayers sending one token in one slot: exactly one transaction is accepted, whichever comes first;
  8. a top-up across a fee tier's edge (1,000 and 50,000) pays the difference between the two schedule values;
  9. a random walk over a Balance's day and total counters: they equal what was funded and never pass a limit."""
