"""`knos receipt verify` answers in a time the reader is told (knos.receipt.from_chain).

It rebuilt a receipt by reading the escrow's newest 1,000 transactions one by one. devnet's public endpoint takes 40
requests of one method per 10 seconds, so that took minutes and printed nothing: the 0.3.25 run saw it "never answer".
Each request now waits at most what is left of one budget, and past it the command says so in one line. The cluster
and the clock here are stand-ins: no network, no waiting on the wall clock."""
