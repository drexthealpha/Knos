"""The pricing page is a calculator (web/pricing.js, web/price.js), and it gives the numbers of src/knos/billing.py.

tests/web/price.mjs holds the arithmetic to tests/data/billing_vectors.json with no browser; tests/web/pricing.mjs opens
the calculator in headless Chromium and types the years of that file into it. No node, no `playwright` package or no
browser: skipped, with the reason."""
