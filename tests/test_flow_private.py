"""PRIVATE work orders, driven from an organisation's ATTESTOR repository (knos.flow, "the attestor").

Two repositories: acme/vault-core is private (tests/_flow.py's GitHub, under that name) and runs nothing; acme/knos-settle
is its attestor, PUBLIC here (`Public`, below): its job's own token reaches only itself, it reads the private one through
the read token (`reader`), mints there, and posts its tokens on its own "knos tokens" issue, where the public worker
(played by `Public.wait_for`, with knos.proof.ghrelay's own regexes, note and log line) finds them.

The last test is the reason for the rest: nothing of the private repository is in any public place."""
