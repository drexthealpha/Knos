"""The documents a newcomer opens first start in plain words.

Each opens with the mark, then its title, then an "In plain words" summary of three sentences that a reader of about
twelve can follow: a Flesch-Kincaid grade of 8 at most. Where a document has a diagram, it is a ```mermaid block
(GitHub draws it, in light and dark, so no colours or themes are set) with a one-line caption in italics under it.

The Flesch-Kincaid grade is 0.39 * (words / sentences) + 11.8 * (syllables / words) - 15.59 (Kincaid, Fishburne,
Rogers and Chissom, 1975). Syllables are counted by a fixed rule, with no dictionary: groups of vowels, less a silent
final "e" and a silent "-ed"; a number counts as two; a word in capitals (USDC) is read letter by letter.
