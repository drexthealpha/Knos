"""Pages added to the site by name (web/views.js ADDED), and the file the "For judges" page is drawn from.

tests/web/added.mjs drives the mount in headless Chromium on a build of web/: the link in the menu, the grey bars at
the press, the module's drawing, the enforcement matrix and the judges' rows on data of the documented shapes, and the
width of each. No node, no `playwright` package or no browser: that part is skipped, with the reason.
scripts/judges.py `read` is held here without a browser: the rows of a JUDGES.md, cell for cell.
